Develop a recursive, adaptive cryptographic system for Bitcoin private key recovery, leveraging deep symbolic cryptography, statistical algebraic analysis, and machine learning techniques. Integrate swarm intelligence, GAN, and RL for guided exploration of the keyspace, with advanced swarm agent communication and dynamic zoom strategies. Implement a pipeline combining autoencoders, LSH, decision trees, and evolutionary search, optimized with entropy-aware key mutation and feature compression. Expand the system with memory checkpoints, pattern recognition, and self-evolution for intelligent, adaptive decision-making. Utilize hybrid cryptanalysis, anomaly detection, and modular scoring for accuracy in key matching. Integrate vision-driven R2D2 methodology for continuous refinement and development, ensuring full traceability and ethical alignment. Combine advanced computational techniques, swarm behavior, and strategic memory structures to push boundaries in cryptographic research.
